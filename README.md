# Posture-detector
Bad Posture has been a major problem from ages but has been ignored throughout. Most of the people are unaware of their posture since early ages and hence are likely to ignore the ill effects of having an improper posture. This project aims at the detection of posture while sitting. A good sitting posture means, shoulders are relaxed, feet are flat on floor, and back supported to maintain the spinal curvatures properly to sit up straight. Thus the combination of a few sensors-accelerometers, microcontroller with arduino mega and MATLAB software used simultaneously provides us with 2 sets of values which can be compared and the person will know the changes that are to be made for attaining the good posture.
